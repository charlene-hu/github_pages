## Github Pages

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through Github.

- User & Organization Pages : One per user account. http://username.github.io/. Content from the master branch will be used to build and publish your GitHub Pages site.
- Project Pages : One per repository. http://username.github.io/projectname. The gh-pages branch is used to build and publish Project Pages sites.
- Warning: GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if their repositories are private.

## Jekyll

- GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware static site generator.
- Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page.
- Jekyll uses the [Liquid templating](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) language to process templates. All of the standard Liquid tags and filters are supported.
- Jekyll isnâ€™t officially supported on Windows, but [it is still possible to run it](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation) if you&#39;re prepared to get your hands dirty.
- Jekyll official site http://jekyllrb.com/

## Using Jekyll

- Every GitHub Page is run through Jekyll when you push content to a specially named branch within your repository.
- Because a normal HTML site is also a valid Jekyll site, you don't have to do anything special to keep your standard HTML files unchanged.
- It is recommended installing Jekyll on your computer to preview your site and help diagnose troubled builds before publishing your site on GitHub Pages.
