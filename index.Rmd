## What are Github Pages?

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through Github.

- User Pages : One per user account. http://username.github.io/. Content from the master branch will be used to build and publish your GitHub Pages site.
- Project Pages : One per repository. http://username.github.io/projectname. The gh-pages branch is used to build and publish Project Pages sites.
- Warning: GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if their repositories are private.

## Using Jekyll with Pages

- In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware static site generator.
- Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page.
- Every GitHub Page is run through Jekyll when you push content to a specially named branch within your repository.
- Because a normal HTML site is also a valid Jekyll site, you don't have to do anything special to keep your standard HTML files unchanged.
